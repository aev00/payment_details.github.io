**Payment details**

The valuation you indicate for a lottery potentially determines your additional bonus payment. Here, we provide an explanation for how exactly this calculation works.

Let us refer to the highest payment a lottery offers as the lottery's upside, and the lowest payment the lottery offers as its downside. We denote these as _U_ and _D_, respectively. We call your valuation _V_.

First, the computer will draw a random number (_p_) from the interval between _D_ and _U_. If your valuation is at least as high as this number (_V_ $\geq$ _p_), you get the lottery which is played for you by the computer. If your valuation is lower than this number (_V_ < _p_), then you get the a payment equal to this number _p_.

Though this might seem complicated, all it means is that it’s in your best interest to tell us how much the lottery is actually worth to you.
