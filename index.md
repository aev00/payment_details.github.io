**Payment details**

The valuation you indicate for a lottery potentially determines your additional bonus payment. Here, we provide an explanation for how exactly this calculation works.

Let us refer to the highest payment a lottery offers as the lottery's upside, and the lowest payment the lottery offers as its downside. We denote these as _U_ and _D_, respectively. We call your valuation _V_.

The computer will draw a random number (_p_) from the interval between _D_ and _U_. If your valuation is at least as high as this number (_V_ ```\geq``` _p_), then you get the lottery which gets played for you by the computer. If your valuation is lower than this number (_V_ < _p_), then you get the a payment equal to this number _p_.

To illustrate, consider the lottery from the example: 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With probability 25%: Get $ 10

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With probability 75%: Get $  1

Suppose that you indicated this lottery is worth to you as much as getting $ 3 for sure.

Now, as described above the computer draws a random number (_P ~ U(1, 10)_). Imagine this is 4, larger than your valuation. Therefore, your additional bonus payment is $4.

Though this might seem complicated, all it means is that itâ€™s in your best interest to tell us how much the lottery is actually worth to you.
